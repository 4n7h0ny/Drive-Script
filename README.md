# Drive-Script
Script to upload documents to a folder on google drive
I am having trouble getting the email confirmation to work
please bear with me if I am not using the correct coding edicate or formating, I am an accountant by trade and actually have close
to no idea what I am doing, just reading how to guides online

I would like a confirmation email to be sent to the user when a file is uploaded, everything else in the script is working fine
